When Phil Leotardo visits Johnny Sack in jail he assures him he's playing nice, but complains that Tony wants the same split on the Office Park deal as the Esplanade. Phil tells him to hold firm---"But don't turn it into World War III." Eugene Pontecorvo has inherited $2 million from his aunt, and he and his wife Deanne see his inheritance as a way out. Gene goes to Tony with a gift and a request for a favor: permission to retire to Florida. Tony's not thrilled, but when he agrees to think about it, Gene gives Deanne the green light to make an offer on their Florida dream house.Hanging out at the Pork Store, Vito boasts that the only problem with losing weight is that he may have to join Clothing Anonymous, "You shoulda called your sponsor before you bought that jacket," says Ray Curto. Agent Harris shows up with his new partner, Goddard. "Where you been," Tony asks. "I got some new federale in my rearview the last six months." Harris, it turns out, was transferred to Terrorism and just got back from Pakistan where the only thing he caught was a parasite.After dinner at a Chinese restaurant, Hesh and his son-in-law, Eli, are jumped. Hesh escapes, but running away, Eli is hit and dragged by a taxi. He survives, barely. Seems one of Phil's guys- Gerry Torciano - thinks Eli is freelancing in Brooklyn, when in fact he was just collecting for Hesh. Hesh calls in Tony to straighten things out, but Phil seems in no hurry to accommodate. When Phil is slow to return a call, Tony complains to his crew that he needs to use Ginny's brother as a back channel to Johnny Sack. T blows up: "What the f$#% is it? I can't catch a f*%$#*' break?"He catches one-though he doesn't even know it-- when Ray Curto keels over just as he's about to tell Agent Robyn Sanseverino what he's got on Tony. The Feds have lost another informant. Meanwhile Tony visits Ginny's brother, optometrist Anthony Infante, to ask him to pass along a message to his brother-in-law Johnny Sack. When Anthony next accompanies his sister Ginny on visiting day, he passes it along: "The guy from Jersey asked me to talk to you." Johnny tells Anthony to have Phil deal with it. Junior's mind is playing tricks again-he's convinced that Pussy Malanga is stalking him, and that he stole 40 Gs from a job back in the '70s. Tony can't take it. But when he complains to Melfi and she suggests assisted living, Tony cites family loyalty. Melfi hammers at Tony about his mother and his denial about her, and he turns on her: "What was your mother like?" But Melfi's not fazed: "She was controlling and manipulative at times. She also never tried to kill me." After much delay, Phil shows up for a meeting at the Bada Bing offering 50k for Eli's troubles. That settled, they move on to the Office Park. When Tony agrees to a 65/35 split, Christopher balks. "I'm not caving, it's a strategy," Tony explains. "Johnny's in jail. You keep him happy, he'll keep a lid on Phil." Christopher orders Gene to take care of a bad debtor, promising to put in a good word to Tony "on that Florida thing" in exchange. But after Gene shoots Teddy Spirodakis in a fast food chicken joint, Silvio breaks the news that Florida's out. Deanne is devastated- "Tony, Tony! Why don't you kill him?....You think I don't know you've done it before?" she screams. It only gets worse when the Feds call in Gene, who we learn has been a cooperator, and tell him he's got to replace Curto as their man on the inside. Feeling as if he has no choice, Gene hangs himself.Called off a cruise on the Stugots II to babysit Junior, T bust in on Janice and Bacala, but she's too busy with her new baby to help out. "F$#@ it! You want something done, do it yourself." Tony makes dinner while Junior goes to look for his teeth. But the aging wiseguy finds a gun instead, and in a fit of paranoia, shoots Tony in the stomach. Junior hides in the closet while Tony struggles to make it to a phone to call 911."
"75299","306216","tt0705258","Join the Club","6","2","2006-03-19","I'm 46 years old. I mean who am I? Where am I going? Tony wakes up in an anonymous business hotel room and heads to the bar for a drink. He calls home and gets the answering machine with...a young boy and girl: "Hi, you've reached the Sopranos." He smiles and leaves a message.The next morning signing in for a conference, Tony realizes he has the wrong wallet and briefcase when the picture ID he presents belongs to "Kevin Finnerty", a solar heating systems salesman from Arizona. Tony calls home-but the woman offering consolation is not Carmela. He heads back to the bar to see if he can find his belongings-or Finnerty, since he can't get on a plane or check back into his room without his own ID. A group of business travelers overhear his dilemma and invite him to join them for dinner. After dinner, outside the hotel, Tony makes a pass at a woman from the group-she reciprocates briefly but cuts him off. "This isn't going to happen...I saw your face when you got off the phone with your wife."A helicopter hovers overhead. Tony looks up into its searchlight...and suddenly he is in a hospital intensive care unit, with doctors working on him. Carmela and Meadow are at his side.Christopher, Silvio, Vito and Paulie wait for news, camped out in the hospital waiting room. It's not good. Tony's on a ventilator; Junior's gun shot damaged his internal organs. "Does he know he's dying?" asks Carmela. "We don't know," the doctor replies. Meanwhile, business traveler Tony checks into another hotel using Kevin Finnerty's credit card. A couple of Buddhist monks overhear him checking in and thinking he is Finnerty, accost him: "We had a horrible winter at the monastery because of your heating system." They scuffle but flee before Tony can find out more about Finnerty.After another restless night, Tony takes the stairs when the hotel elevator is out of order. When he trips and falls down a flight, we flash back to the hospital room where his family is camped out. Dr. Plepler warns Carmela about possible brain damage and urges them to talk to Tony, maybe play him some favorite music. Janice breaks down when she visits.In custody, Junior is being questioned by a psychologist to determine if he shot Tony intentionally. But Junior is confused. "If somebody shot my nephew it was him himself. He's a depression case." At Eugene's funeral, Silvio briefs the crew on how he'll run things in Tony's absence. Vito stirs things up asking for Eugene's "sports book in Roseville," bringing up Junior and asking why Bobby wasn't babysitting instead of Tony. "He's gotta make an issue out of everything," Christopher complains to Silvio.Carmela plays CDs for Tony and reminisces, urging him to keep fighting. "I know that you're really strong, as strong as a bull." Christopher stops by the Pork Store and sees Agents Harris and Goddard, who test the waters with him as an informant on Harris's new terrorism beat. "If you ever heard of anything going down-Middle-Easterners, Pakistanis-you'd be helping a lot if you picked up the phone." Anthony Jr., who has been avoiding taking his turn at the hospital, finally sits with his father into the night. He promises to get Uncle Junior for this. "I'm gonna put a bullet in his f&%$in' mummy head. I promise." Carmela praises Anthony for helping his family and he takes the opportunity to confide that he flunked out of school. Her mood changes: "My God. With your father in a coma." At a hospital, business traveler Tony is diagnosed with Alzheimer's after falling down the stairs. When he returns to his hotel room, he stares at the phone, but can't bring himself to call home."

After a fight and a bloodbath, Paulie and Cary ransack the place and find a dishwasher full of cash.At the hospital where the family is still sitting vigil while Tony fights for his life, Chris and Bobby confront AJ about trying to buy a gun. They are sympathetic to his anger but warn: "you can't go there," and tell him to channel his anger elsewhere.In his dream, Tony finds a summons for Kevin Finnerty from the Crystal Monastery. He goes to the Monastery looking for help finding Finnerty but they don't believe he's not their man. Tony returns to the hotel bar and confides to the bartender he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and asks if it's possible he is Kevin Finnerty.Carmela runs into Dr. Melfi in the grocery store. The shrink offers her help but Carmela puts her off: "I have plenty of people around to talk to."Silvio confides to his wife Gabrielle that he's a reluctant acting boss-he was quasi-offered the job before T but has never seen himself that way. "I'm more behind the scenes-advice, strategy." But Silvio has to step up. Bobby and Vito are still fighting over who's taking over the Roseville collections. Silvio gives it to Bobby-kicking up 20 percent to Vito for "the time being." Next, Silvio rules from the throne as Paulie and Vito argue in the men's room over how to split the million dollars from the Colombian take down. "It breaks half and half and you both kick Tony's to me to deal with." As the recovering addict and degenerate gambler/screenwriter JT gives a talk at the Writer's Guild, Benny and Murmur walk in, slam him in the head and whisk him off to a back-seat meeting with Christopher. A deal if offered: If JT pens Christopher's movie idea - "it's Saw meets Godfather 2" - he'll wipe his debt. Christopher gives him until the next day to develop a pitch to present to an investor's group. At the meeting, hosted by Little Carmine, Chris introduces the set up: "It's about a wise guy with a big mouth and bigger dreams." As JT tries to tell the story the skeptical investors interrupt with commentary and critiques.After dinner with their wives, Vito feels out his cousin Phil Leotardo about shorting Carmela-it's "money down the drain" if Tony dies. "It's temping but you can't think that way," warns Phil. Paulie is equally uninterested in handing over his piece of pie to Carmela, but as Little Paulie says, "the boss's wife, what can you do?"As Tony's dream continues, he calls home but can't bring himself to reveal his Alzheimer's diagnosis. He's found a flyer for the Finnerty family reunion in his briefcase and decides to go and confront his doppelganger.Carmela blows up at AJ when she sees a news story where AJ's quoted saying "Growing up Soprano? It's just plain weird." After her meltdown, Carmela goes to see Dr. Melfi for help dealing with AJ. But Melfi pushes Carmela to talk about how she's doing, and Carm talks about her guilt over making her kids complicit in how Tony makes his money. Plus -- there's the issue of whether she really loves Tony.Silvio's feeling the pressure, and Gabrielle pushes him to be getting more compensation. And when Bobby comes by to complain again about having to give 20 percent of Roseville to Vito, the combined stress makes Silvio's asthma kick up and he's rushed to the hospital. With Silvio and Tony both "on the canvas" Vito has his eyes on the boss's job. At the hospital Finn arrives to be with Meadow just as Paulie's talking makes Tony's blood pressure drop and he goes into cardiac arrest. The doctors rush in with the paddles. In his dream, Tony arrives at the Finnery reunion. They've been expecting him. Confused, he hears a little girl calling "Don't go Daddy." Back in ICU Meadow calls out to her father. Tony surprises everyone by not only coming back to life, but waking up. He's back. Paulie hands over the cash to Vito and tells him they have to get their cuts to Carmela now. "Tony's conscious, do you capice?" When they hand it over, Carmela sees through the timing of their generosity."

He complains to his nurse that he's not feeling like himself. "My thoughts keep running away from me." She assures him that's normal for patients in his condition. Religious evangelicals Aaron Aarkaway and Bob Brewster barge in on Tony the night before his surgery to pray with him. Tony accepts their prayer, but questions whether their stance on birth control could be a slippery slope to banning Viagra-which he imagines he'll be needing in his post-operative state. "What are you, a wiseass," asks Carmela after shooing them away. When Jason Barone's father dies, Jason suddenly has to decide what to do with Barone Sanitation, but he's been kept in the dark about the true nature of the family business. He doesn't understand why Tony is the second highest paid employee on the books, and Paulie brings him in for a hospital visit. Jason is planning to sell Barone to Chucky Cinelli, but Tony insists he let him take care of it. "This carting business," he says, "It's a different corporate culture."Paulie is summoned to his Aunt Dottie's death bed at the convent, and she's got a bombshell: Dottie, a nun, is Paulie's real mother. "I was a bad girl." The news sends Paulie into a tailspin. He boycotts Dottie's funeral and disowns Nucci, the mother/aunt who raised him. At the hospital, it turns out the rap artist Da Lux is on Tony's floor. Apparently his own shooting is helping his CD sales. "Yeah but it really hurts," moans Da Lux. Bobby overhears one of Da Lux's posse, Marvin, writing a rap. Marvin complains that Da Lux is now too busy to produce his album this year. Bobby suggests it might make Marvin more popular if he got shot too and offers to help him out. Marvin eventually agrees, paying Bobby to make a surprise hit.Tony meets with Phil outside the hospital, his IV pole in one hand, a cigar in the other. "You go around me...and try and poach my company," he accuses Phil, suggesting that he and Johnny Sack tried to take over Barone Sanitation. Tony needs the W-2, not to mention the health insurance, and insists he stay on payroll and get 25 percent of the sale price. Phil says he'll take the message to Johnny.Da Lux invites Tony and Schwinn (a fellow patient) to watch a boxing match on the flat screen in his hospital room. When Paulie moans about how alone we all are, Schwinn counters that we’re all connected. "Everythang is Everthang," says Da Lux. "I'm down with that."Johnny Sack offers Tony two years on payroll and five percent of the sale price and a new car. Tony vomits at the news, ordering Paulie to intervene. Paulie and Patsy make a threatening visit to Jason, warning him that Tony's take will come out of Jason's profits. But when Jason tries to back out of the Cinelli sale, he finds he can't. Tony calls Jason to his bedside and lets him have it. When Jason's mother comes to beg for mercy for her son, Paulie is overwhelmed, seeing the mother's love he felt never had.Bob Brewster makes one last visit to try and save Tony, but the boss resists his message. Still, Tony confides to Schwinn he's starting to believe we're all part of something bigger. Back home, Phil comes to Tony with Johnny Sack's final offer: T keeps his paycheck and W-2 for 10 years and 12 percent of the sale price-but no skim. Tony agrees. "Truth be told, there's enough garbage for everybody." But Paulie can't let it go of his problem. He takes a pipe to Jason's kneecap, insisting Jason kick up $4000 a month to him-and not a word to Tony."

Seems everyone around Tony is in better shape than he is these days.Tony goes for his first visit back to Dr. Melfi since the shooting.

He insists on focusing his session on AJ. Tony heads to the Pork Store back room to see everyone, comparing scars with Christopher and bemoaning his physical state.

It's a family problem." Christopher has to take a call before he can respond.Lawyers argue over Junior's mental state. When Carmela sees the morning paper headline touting Junior's "cushy psych lockup" she tosses it before Tony can see. At the psych facility Junior insists he's innocent - it was a gun malfunction - and begs to go home.On the day of Allegra's wedding, Tony pressures Meadow about when she's getting married and giving him grandkids. At the Church, security checks at the church door make for a long line to get in. When Tony sets off the metal detector, he collapses trying to take off his shoes for a search as the other guests look on.

Surrounded by Marshals, Tony and Johnny join Johnny's father and elderly relatives and discuss the situation in code. Tony gives in. When he talks to Christopher about farming it out (somebody from Naples), Christopher argues that he doesn't think it's a good idea. When his time is up, Johnny is hauled away by the Marshals, sobbing in front of Allegra and the guests who have gathered for her departure. Ginny faints at the scene.

Vito heads out to "make some collections"- but heads to a gay bar instead. At the bar, he's spotted by a fellow wise guy and panics. He sneaks back home and gets a gun and heads to a Motel. At 3 a.m. he calls Silvio "just to check in" but Silvio just wants to go back to sleep.Back at Melfi's, Tony complains about people questioning his judgment since he's out of the hospital.

"Enough with the rush to judgment," warns Tony.At the law clinic, Meadow helps a Muslim family whose son was arrested by the Feds and is being held with no explanation.

Tony tells her "You oughta chill out about some of this."Benny and Terry Doria track Vito down at the shore where he's laying low with his goomar (who hasn't been serviced in over a year and is sexually frustrated). When they try to bring him in for a talk, Vito screeches off in his car. He stops by his house to pick up some cash and kiss his kids goodbye-then takes off in a rain storm. When Phil calls his cell, Vito tosses it out the window. His car breaks down in the storm, and Vito checks into an inn in New Hampshire, slipping his gun under his pillow.Meanwhile, Tony and Christopher have lined up the Italians to take care of Rusty for Johnny Sack. Christopher enlists heroin addict Corky Caporale, who speaks Italian, to relay the necessary information on the hit on "the little guy in Ozone Park." Corky's already heard the rumors about Vito. Carmela's spec house has been ransacked. She confronts her father about it but he blames her for not taking care of the permits. She reminds Tony again about talking to the building inspector, but he keeps forgetting.With Vito gone AWOL, Silvio goes to see Vito's wife to suss out how things are "in the romance department." She refuses to talk about it. "Vito is a good father and a loving husband." Silvio leaves, and tells Tony. "My business, I'm around a lot of women. That one ain't getting laid."Carmela, Rosalie and Gabriella have a lunch meeting at Artie's to discuss the Silent Auction they're planning for charity. Angie arrives late, takes charge, and then has to get back to work, irritating Carmela. Later, Carmela walks in on Angie having a suspicious business meeting with Patsy and Benny at the body shop. Rosalie tells her that Angie's putting money on the street: "She's one of us; now it's like she's one of them." At Melfi's, Tony vents about Vito being gay-and the pressure of his top earner losing everyone's respect. Melfi points out that many in his circle have done jail time and can't be strangers to "male-male contact." "They get a pass for that," says Tony. Tony ultimately admits Vito may deserve a second chance, like he's gotten. "Part of your new outlook," notes Melfi.

Tony still wants to think about it.Phil goes to see Marie to console her about Vito and to fish for where he might have disappeared to. Tony gives Carlo a promotion-replacing Vito in all construction business. Carlo confides that the guys in Vito's crew won't work with him if he returns. Other captains want him found and "put down" for the honor of the family. Tony argues Vito's his best earner: "Let's be honest with ourselves here. We all know Vito's not the first." Silvio counsels Tony not to cut Vito any slack. Meadow and Finn argue about her disgust over the injustice of Johnny Sack's humiliation by the Feds at his daughter's wedding, vs. the white collar criminals she's investigating at her internship. Finn, still shook up from his own interrogation about Vito points out that her family will likely impose a stiff penalty for being gay. "This is untenable," says Meadow, leaving.With all the discord over Vito, Tony can't turn the other cheek. "He's gotta go. Tell everybody I said so." Meanwhile in New Hampshire, Vito tries to track down cousins who live somewhere in the state but can't find any listings. Taking in the small town ambience, he finds himself at home with the peace and quiet and friendly interactions-not to mention the antique shops."

There are grumblings that Artie's game is off as they wait for their meal-and rumors about the incredible food at a new place: Da Giovanni's. Vito's still missing but Tony wants to take a break from the search, which is good news for Chris who wants to take time off for a trip to LA with Little Carmine-they want to attach Ben Kingsley to "Cleaver." Tony balks, but lets him go.Phil holds his grandson's confirmation lunch at Da Giovanni's and though the food has everyone raving, Tony feels like he's betraying Artie: "I feel like some kind a traitor." Meanwhile, Vesuvio's is nearly empty-except for Benny making moves on the new hostess Martina. Artie, jealous, calls her aside and tells her he can't help her with green card after all. At the Bada Bing, Artie laments that the most he can get from the strippers is a lap dance--and chides Tony for having lunched at Da Giovanni's.

Charmaine suggests Artie shouldn't talk to the customers so much and Artie blows up. "You know better than NJ Zagat: 'Arthur Bucco, warm and convivial host'?"

Sir Ben begs off their meeting, vowing to finish it in New York. Artie gets a visit from American Express fraud investigators. Someone's been stealing the customer credit card numbers. Artie can't use Amex until it's cleared up and has to resort to two-fers after all. Martina calls Benny, who's dining at Da Giovanni's with his pregnant wife, to alert him.

In a rage, he heads to Benny's house and beats the crap out of himWhen Chris, strung out on coke, champagne and hookers calls to see if Sir Ben's publicist can get him into the Luxury Lounge, he demurs.

Tony finally tells him no one wants to hear him talk: "Just stay in the kitchen, that'd be a start."When Chris brings Tony some swag, T suggests maybe Benny and Artie wouldn't have gotten into it if he hadn't been in LA. Chris argues not many have had to sacrifice what he has. "How many times you gonna play the Adriana card?" demands Tony.

Packed full of strange whizzy things, blue swirly things, and more than its fair share of spoons, "Do You Have A Licence To Save This Planet?" brings SYLVESTER McCOY into battle against some of the most fearsome (as seen on BBCTV's DOCTOR WHO) monsters of all time.

Armed only with a duffle coat, an umbrella and a patented Sylvester-o-matic-talk-them-to-death-o-tron THE FOOT DOCTOR has come to save the universe once again.

He's back. And it's about feet.

Nobody will listen to the Doctor when he warns them that the Daleks have their own agenda – one which could result in the extermination of all human beings in the colony.

Amid the celebrations, Winters brings his friend Cpt. Nixon to Herman Goring's house, where he presents a "gift" of Goring's impressive liquor collection. The company moves on to Austria, where they learn that those without enough "points", awarded for combat experience, will be sent to fight in the Pacific. Despite all that they've been through, few of the men are eligible to go home.

Winters and Nixon request an immediate transfer to a unit that is going to the Pacific, but they are denied. Winters continues to work to keep the men of his company out of harm's way. Meanwhile, the troops are restless. Liebgott takes Webster to the home of a man he believes was a labor camp Commandant. Despite Webster's concern about Liebgott's lack of proof, when the man tries to escape, he is killed. As the occupation of Zell Am See, Austria continues, one member of the company is killed in a car accident and another is shot in the head by a drunken soldier from another Company. As Winters explains in his narration, "They didn't have the points. What they did have were weapons, alcohol, and too much time on their hands". Thus, even after the official fighting was over, tragedies still occurred and some brave souls only made it home in a pine box. That said, the series ends with the happy news that the Japanese have surrendered, and the surviving men of Easy Company can return home."
